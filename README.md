# Solar Energy Production Forecast

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the amount of electricity produced and consumed by Estonian energy customers who have installed solar panels. By leveraging historical data, we seek to provide accurate forecasts that can help optimize energy production and consumption.

## Data Sources
- **Weather Data**: Includes historical and forecasted weather conditions relevant to solar energy production.
- **Energy Prices**: Historical pricing data which can influence consumption patterns and energy production strategies.
- **Installed Photovoltaic Capacity**: Records of solar panel installations, including capacity and location data.

## Forecasting Approach
We use a time series analysis approach to forecast future energy production and consumption. The model will take into account various factors such as seasonality, weather patterns, and energy price fluctuations.

## How to Use the API
The time series API is designed to be easy to use. To get started:

1. Ensure you have the necessary API credentials and endpoints.
2. Send a `GET` request to the API endpoint with the required parameters (e.g., date range, location).
3. The API will return a forecast in the specified format (e.g., JSON, CSV).

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Set up environment variables for API credentials.
4. Run the provided example scripts to see how the API can be utilized.
