        "Specific Problem: Energy Imbalance Resulting from Prosumers\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary concern is the energy discrepancy that occurs when there is a disparity between the anticipated and the actual energy consumed or generated. The issue is worsened by prosumers contributing to the problem due to their simultaneous roles as energy consumers and producers. Their energy use and generation can be erratic, resulting in logistical and financial difficulties for energy firms like Enefit. These problems encompass the struggle to align supply and demand and the resulting expenditures from this imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Role of the Model in Facilitating Enefit\n",
        "The model aims to address these difficulties by offering precise forecasts of prosumers' energy usage and production. By doing so, the model will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Increase Forecasting Precision: Enhance Enefit's capacity to anticipate energy demands and production levels accurately.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. Minimise Imbalance Expenses: Enefit can optimise its energy allocation by utilising more accurate forecasts, hence decreasing the expenses linked to energy imbalance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Enhance Resource Allocation Efficiency: Precise predictions will allow Enefit to distribute resources more optimally, thereby minimising waste and decreasing operational expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Enhance Strategic Decision-Making: Enefit can improve its ability to make strategic decisions on infrastructure investments and policy changes by gaining deeper insights into consumer behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Encourage Sustainable Habits: Enefit may encourage prosumers to use renewable energy sources through efficient energy management, facilitating the shift towards more environmentally friendly energy habits.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model must incorporate multiple variables that impact consumer behaviour, such as weather patterns, past energy usage trends, pricing fluctuations, etc. The model's performance will be assessed based on its Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which requires your predictions to match the actual values to minimise the error measurement closely.\n",
        "\n",
        "The competition offers a dataset of historical meteorological data, energy pricing, and details regarding prosumer attributes. The given Python time-series API will guarantee that the model complies with the competition's specifications, including the prohibition of looking ahead in time and utilising just the available data for making predictions."
